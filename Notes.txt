Scalar types are the most basic types in a GraphQL schema, with no sub-fields of their own. They are similar to the primitive types in programming languages. GraphQL comes with a 5 default scalar types out of the box: Int, Float, String, Boolean and ID. Itâ€™s also possible to define or import new custom scalar types, based on your application needs. This is something you will learn more about later in the tutorial.
